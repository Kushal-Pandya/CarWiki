This can be caused by a failure in the actuator that controls this feature. Although the actuators are not expenses and can range from $50-$100 per actuator, fixing multiple actuators and paying for labour can be expensive."))

This can be caused by the actual ABS unit burning out. The cost to repair this is rather expensive and can range from anywhere between $700 and $1000."))

The speakers in the doors are the most notorious for this and can stop working due to moisture buildup in the doors. It is important to make sure the radio and all speakers work as this is a common issue and can be detrimental to the future of your used car."))

Drivers have reported that the CD Player will make whirring noises and eject the CD without reason. Fixing this can actually lead to taking out the whole radio unit and sending it in for repair."))
